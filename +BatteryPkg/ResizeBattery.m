% After an aircraft flies a mission, update its battery size based on the
% following:
%     (1) if the final SOC is < 20%, increase the battery's size.
%     (2) if the final SOC is < 23%, decrease the battery's size.
%     (3) if battery discharges too quickly, increase its size.
%
% INPUTS:
%     Aircraft - aircraft structure containing the mission just flown.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - aircraft structure with the updated battery weight and
%                number of cells in the battery.
