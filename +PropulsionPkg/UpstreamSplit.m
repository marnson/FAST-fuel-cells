% Given a energy-power source, power-power source, or power-thrust source
% pair, compute the upstream power splits, defined as:
%
%     UpSplit(i, j) = Power Supplied by j to i / Power Output by j
%
% For the inputs/outputs below, nups and ndwn represent the number of
% upstream sources and the number of downstream sources, respectively.
%
% INPUTS:
%     Pups     - power required at the upstream sources.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-nups / double / [W]
%
%     Pdwn     - power required at the downstream sources.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-ndwn / double / [W]
%
%     Arch     - architecture matrix between the sources.
%                size/type/units: nups-by-ndwn / int / []
%
%     Oper     - (downstream) operational matrix between the sources.
%                size/type/units: nups-by-ndwn / double / [%]
%
%     Eff      - efficiency matrix between the sources.
%                size/type/units: nups-by-ndwn / double / [%]
%
%     PSPSFlag - flag to indicate that power-power sources are being
%                analyzed (1).
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / int / []
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     UpSplit  - the upstream power splits.
%                size/type/units: nups-by-ndwn / double / [%]
